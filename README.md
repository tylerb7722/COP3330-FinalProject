# The purpose of this Java program is to create a database with the ability to add one of three different object classes; Either a Student, Faculty, or Staff, with Faculty and Staff being under both the abstract classes Employee and Person, and the class Student under the abstract class Person. The user has the option to add either students, facultys, or staff to the database and enter the relevent information depending on the class type to store in the database. User can also choose to print tuition invoices for class Students, or print the relevent information of Class Faculty or Staff. User also has functionality to remove specific person from the database. Database also does not allow duplicate id #'s for different people. After user is done and exits program, they have the option to print a report to a text file "report.txt" containing the information of all the classes of "Persons" entered; Employees, Staffs, and Students, stored in the database with their relevent information presented. User can also decide to sort class Students in the report either by descending GPA or by Name. 

To run this code you can either compile all the provided classes in the "src" fiolder into a single file and run the code that way, or download all the classes located in the "src" folder in their respective seperate files and run the program that way such as in Visual Studio Code.
